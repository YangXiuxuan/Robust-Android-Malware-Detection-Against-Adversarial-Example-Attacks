# Robust-Android-Malware-Detection-Against-Adversarial-Example-Attacks




## Features Used in This Paper
This paper uses a total of 379 features collected from .apk file.
There are 126 action features, 106 API features and 147 permission features and these features are shown in **list_total_actions.txt**, **list_total_apis.txt** and **list_total_permissions.txt** respectively.

The code & tools in `feature_extract` can be used to extract features for our model.



## Source Code of Our Model
**VAE2_ms_su.py**, **MLP_util.py**, **VAE_util.py** and **utilities.py** are the source files of our model.
**main.py** is an example of using our model.
The key points are:
- Using `model = VAE2_ms_su.VAE_SU(...)` to build the model
- Using `model.train_mlp(...)` to train the model
- Using `model.get_predict_(...)` to get prediction from the model
